# JOBMadrid-networking-grid

Panel with list of companies and filter by sector, with foundation data, type of industry, number of employees and link to the web.

## Usage

The project is based on an API with company data from which the necessary data for the realization of the panel have been filtered.
Due to a problem with API url cors, the fetch doesn't work correctly. As a solution:
Chrome: open the task runner, write this comand if you are on Windows

```
windows + R
```

and enter the following line of code:

``
chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C://Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security
``
This extension for Chrome is available to fix the problem
